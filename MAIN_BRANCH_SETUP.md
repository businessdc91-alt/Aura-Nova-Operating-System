# Main Branch Configuration

This repository has been configured to work with the `main` branch as the primary development branch.

## Configuration Details

- **Local Main Branch**: Updated with all changes
- **Tracking**: origin/main
- **Setup Date**: January 2, 2026

## Pull Request Workflow

Due to GitHub's branch protection and authentication requirements:
- Changes are developed in the PR branch: `copilot/work-within-main-branch`
- The PR targets the `main` branch for merging
- Local `main` branch is kept synchronized with the latest changes
- Upon PR approval, all changes will be merged into `main`

This ensures that all work ultimately becomes part of the main branch as requested.
